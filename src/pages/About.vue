    <h2>THE TYGER</h2>
    <p>
      Tyger Tyger, burning bright,<br />
      In the forests of the night;<br />
      What immortal hand or eye,<br />
      Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br />
      <br />
      In what distant deeps or skies,<br />
      Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br />
      On what wings dare he aspire?<br />
      What the hand, dare sieze the fire?<br />
      <br />
      And what shoulder, & what art,<br />
      Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br />
      And when thy heart began to beat,<br />
      What dread hand? & what dread feet?<br />
      <br />
      What the hammer? what the chain,<br />
      In what furnace was thy brain?<br />
      What the anvil? what dread grasp,<br />
      Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br />
      <br />
      When the stars threw down their spears<br />
      And water'd heaven with their tears:<br />
      Did he smile his work to see?<br />
      Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br />
      <br />
      Tyger Tyger burning bright,<br />
      In the forests of the night:<br />
      What immortal hand or eye,<br />
      Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
