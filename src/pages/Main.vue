    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<br />
      The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<br />
      Will play the tyrants to the very same<br />
      And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<br />
      <br />
      For never-resting time leads summer on<br />
      To hideous winter and confounds him there;<br />
      Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br />
      Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:<br />
      <br />
      Then, were not summer's distillation left,<br />
      A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br />
      Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br />
      Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:<br />
      <br />
      But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,<br />
      Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.<br />
